# UF_interview
This repo contains UF Technical Interview.

This is a one-hour screening, where we will focus 30-45 minutes on assessing the problem sum and spend rest of the 15-20 mins on Q/A.
This is a paired-coding session and the expectations of this screening is to understand your ability to communicate while solving a problem. For the session we will be using an interactive binder jupyter notebook as shared below. 


You are free to use any reference materials they want during the interview (google is fine, help docs are fine, etc.) but either must share the reference material or screen during the interview so that the partner can watch as they approach the problem. Feel free to ask any questions they have of the interviewer.
